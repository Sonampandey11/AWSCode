Software/ Source Code management
Git-
helps in managing version   - Version Control Sysytem
(we use distributed version control- every machine will have local repository)

Trunk based development- 
branch -master - after same changes we are doing (commit) -4.7 version 
-5.0 version(we can create another branch -newBranch)we can merge(push) your changes to master branch

Basic Git command-
Version Control System for tracking changes in computer files
Distributed Version control -many developer can work on simple project without being on same network
Cordinates work between multiple developers
who made what changes and when
Revert back at any time
local and Remote apps

Concept of git
Keeps track of code history
Takes snapshots of your files
you decide when to take a snapshot by making "commit":
you can visit any snapshot at any time 
You can stage any files before committing(add command)
Once you commit to remote repo others Developer can pull that code
BASIC COMMANDS
$git init - Initailize Local Git Repository
$git add <file> -to add files (see in your staging area- git status
$git commit - Commit changes in Index(That will take everything from index n put in local rep)
//to work with remote repo
$git push -take everything from local repo and push it to remote repo
$git pull -pull latest code from Remote Repository when we want latest version
$git clone -Clone Repository into a new Directory


touch app.html //to create new file
git init
git config --global user.name "Sonampandey11"
git config --global user.email "sonam.pandey@capgemini.com"
i // to write in vim command

git commit -print `(Esc command toescape from vim editor command)
:wq (for exit from the terminal)
git commit -m " " //If we want to escape writing in Vim


git merge developer // to merge all your changes with developr

git remote -v // to seet the url you have added to the origin
